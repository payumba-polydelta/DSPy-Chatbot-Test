Tuition Assistance is a benefit paid to eligible members of the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard. Congress has given each service the ability to pay up to 100 percent for the tuition expenses of its members. If TA does not cover fees required by the College, the service member is responsible for paying the out-of-pocket fees. Each service has its own criteria for eligibility, obligated service, application processes, and restrictions. This money is usually paid directly to the institution by the individual services. For more information on using Tuition Assistance, students should contact their branch of service education office or NOVA's Military Services Office at militaryservices@nvcc.edu.
