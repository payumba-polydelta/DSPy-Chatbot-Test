        "context": "These limitations include all terms of enrollment, whether or not aid was awarded or received. At NOVA, satisfactory academic progress standards apply also to nonfederal aid, including state funds, institutional funds, and foundation scholarships. Progress is measured throughout the academic program by the student's cumulative grade point average (Qualitative) and by credits earned as a percentage of those attempted (Quantitative or Pace of Completion). In addition, students must complete their programs of study before attempting 150 percent of the credits required to complete the program. The College Financial Aid Office will evaluate satisfactory academic progress before aid is awarded and again after most grades are posted for every term, starting with the first term of enrollment.  Financial Aid Status Financial Aid Good Standing (GS) Students who are meeting all aspects of the satisfactory academic progress policy or successfully following a designated academic progress plan are in good standing. Financial Aid Warning Status (WS) Students who fail to meet satisfactory academic progress for the first time (excluding students who have already attempted 150 percent of the credits required for their programs of study or those flagged by the Department of Education for having unusual enrollment history) will be automatically placed in a warning status for one term and are expected to meet SAP requirements by the end of that term. Students who fail to meet SAP requirements at the end of the warning status term will be placed on financial aid suspension. However, with a successful SAP appeal, those students will be placed on financial aid probation and will retain financial aid eligibility.  Applications should be completed several months in advance of the semester for which assistance is needed. Applicants for all aid rograms, including loans and work study, must file the FAFSA. Completed applications received by March 1 for Fall, October | for Spring, and April 1 for Summer will receive priority consideration. Additional information on scholarships, grants, loans, and on-campus employment, as well as information about financial aid policies pertaining to class attendance, recalculation of awards, satisfactory academic progress, and repayment of funds, can be found in the Student Services Financial Aid Handbook and at www.nvec.edu\/financialaid. NOVA Financial Aid Satisfactory Progress Standards Federal regulations require that a student receiving federal financial aid make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) in accordance with the standards set by NOVA and the federal government.  Students in suspension status are not eligible to receive financial aid unless an appeal and academic plan are submitted and approved. Academic Suspension (AS) Academic requirements for avoiding warning status and staying in school differ from financial aid requirements for satisfactory academic progress. Academic status will be noted on registration records; financial aid status will be noted on financial aid screens in the Student Information System (NOVAConnect). Any student suspended from NOVA for academic or behavioral reasons is automatically ineligible for financial aid. Evaluating Progress Quantitative Standards or Pace of Completion Completion Rate (67 Percent Rule): Students must, at a minimum, receive satisfactory grades in 67 percent of cumulative credits attempted. This calculation is performed by dividing the cumulative total number of successfully completed credits by the cumulative total number of credits attempted.  Any change in status must be reported to the Department of Veterans Affairs as soon as possible, but no more than 30 days after the change has been officially completed at the College. Students who are using veteran related benefits will be responsible of overpayment of BAH, tuition, or book stipend due to not attending class(es) or any changes in enrollment. Satisfactory Progress Policy for Recipients of Veterans Benefits To be eligible for veterans' educational benefits, students must maintain satisfactory academic progress in accordance with Northern Virginia Community College standards. Students will be reported to the Department of Veterans Affairs as making unsatisfactory progress if their cumulative GPA falls below the required level based on the following: Regular Credits Attempted (A, B,C, |Minimum Cumulative D,F) GPA Requirement 13-23 credits 1.50 24-47 credits 1.75 48 or more credits 2.00 This standard will be applied each term.

        "question": "What is the Satisfactory Academic Progress policy, and how does it affect financial aid?",
        "answer": "Based on the provided context, the Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy at NOVA and its effect on financial aid can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Definition: SAP is a set of standards that students receiving federal financial aid must meet to maintain their eligibility.\n2. Application: The policy applies to federal aid, state funds, institutional funds, and foundation scholarships.\n3. Measurement: SAP is measured by two main factors:\na) Cumulative grade point average (Qualitative)\nb) Credits earned as a percentage of those attempted (Quantitative or Pace of Completion)\n4. Time frame: Students must complete their programs before attempting 150% of the credits required for their program.\n5. Evaluation: The Financial Aid Office evaluates SAP before awarding aid and after grades are posted each term.\n6. Financial Aid Statuses:\na) Good Standing (GS): Students meeting all SAP requirements\nb) Warning Status (WS): First-time failure to meet SAP requirements\nc) Suspension: Failure to meet SAP requirements after the warning period\n7. Effect on Financial Aid:\n- Students in good standing retain financial aid eligibility\n- Students on warning status retain eligibility for one term\n- Students on suspension lose financial aid eligibility unless they successfully appeal and are placed on probation\n8. Quantitative Standard: Students must receive satisfactory grades in at least 67% of cumulative credits attempted.\n9. Appeals: Students can appeal their suspension status to potentially retain financial aid eligibility.\n\nThe policy ensures that students receiving financial aid are making progress towards completing their academic programs within a reasonable time frame."

The student will be provided a copy of the documentation. All \"I\" grades that have not been changed by the faculty member through the normal grade change processes will be subsequently changed to the default grade assigned by the faculty member. An \"I\" grade will be changed to a'\"W\" only under documented mitigating circumstances, which must be approved by the provost. P = Pass - No grade point credit.

Only seven credit hours of \"P\" grades may be applied toward graduation.

For example, a student placed in the 2017-2018 catalog year may be eligible to graduate up until Summer 2024; e taken courses at NOVA that total at least 25 percent of the credit to be applied to the curriculum (ABLE credit does not count toward the residency requirement); e earned a grade point average of at least 2.00 in courses attempted that are applicable toward graduation in the curriculum; e applied for graduation online on or before the published dates ; and e resolved all financial obligations to the College and returned all materials, including library books.

Removal from financial aid does not prevent students from enrolling without financial aid if they are otherwise eligible to continue their enrollment.

Financial aid can be considered for successfully completed classes that are repeated to achieve a higher grade but for only one additional attempt. Only the latest attempt will count toward the cumulative grade point average. Please visit the \"Repeating a course\" section.
